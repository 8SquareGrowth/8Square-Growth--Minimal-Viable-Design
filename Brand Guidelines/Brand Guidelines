3. Colours
A sophisticated "Dark Mode" palette featuring your signature neon accents for high-energy interaction points.

3. Design & Spacing
The "8-Square" Rule: All padding, margins, and gaps must be multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 128).
Corner Geometry: Maintain sharp 0px or minimal 4px radii to reflect the "Square" in the brand name.
Layout Philosophy: Use massive negative space (128px+ vertical margins) to emphasize technical precision and avoid visual clutter.

4. Brand Persona
Tone: Professional, clinical, and authoritative.
Energy: Medium—active and forward-moving, but consistently calm and composed.
Voice: "Data-backed clarity"—focus on ROI, efficiency, and scalable systems over marketing hype.
